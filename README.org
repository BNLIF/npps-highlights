#+title: EDG Highlights for NPPS

This page attempts to collect highlights of software-related activity
by EDG members that may be interesting to NPPS.  Below are weekly
summaries.  Less frequently updated but more focused updates on
Wire-Cell can be found in the [[https://wirecell.github.io/news/][Wire-Cell News blog]].

* Weekly highlights

- DUNE FD DAQ began technical discussions about how to handle "observability" with initial focus on metrics.  Two presentations are here https://indico.fnal.gov/event/22481/.  Of particular note to NPPS, I mentioned Sergey Padolski's BDT work for Panda as something we should look into more.

- [[https://indico.bnl.gov/event/6383/contributions/32818/attachments/25515/38251/srv-dune-fd-daq-bv.pdf][DUNE DAQ at SRV]] describes the prototype streaming trigger/readout software and some results of [[https://github.com/brettviren/zperfmq][ZeroMQ performance]] on 100 Gbps ATLAS/DUNE/sPHENIX LDRD test network.

- [[https://www.bnl.gov/dmo2019/][Module of oprotunity]] workshop at BNL discussed what DUNE might put in as the fourth of four far detector modules.  Mostly physics and detector related.   [[https://indico.fnal.gov/event/21535/contribution/22/material/slides/0.pptx][Xin Qian's talk]] shows many Wire-Cell results and includes some new ideas on LArTPC signal processing including early promising results using deep learning by our post-doc Haiwang Yu.

- Couple of notes posted
  - [[http://docs.dunescience.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=16973][DUNE DocDB 16973]] some unfinished notes on "observability" systems of possible interest for DUNE FD DAQ.
  - [[http://docs.dunescience.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=16976][DUNE DocDB 16976]] write up of performance evaluation of ZeroMQ on 100 Gbps using ZperfMQ.
