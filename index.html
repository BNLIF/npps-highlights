This page attempts to collect highlights of software-related activity
by EDG members that may be interesting to NPPS.  Below are weekly
summaries.  Less frequently updated but more focused updates on
Wire-Cell can be found in the <a href="https://wirecell.github.io/news/">Wire-Cell News blog</a>.

<div class="note">
<p>
All EDG members are welcome to contribute directly to this list,
although probably all these words are from <code>bv@bnl.gov</code> and thus biased
by my viewpoint.  If others wish to contribute, let's do something to

<p>
It's been a couple months since the last update, what with the world
as we know it changing.  In no particular order, here are some
software-related things that have happened in that time:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added a general purpose tensor data type to WCT (<a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-toolkit/blob/master/iface/inc/WireCellIface/ITensor.h"><code>ITensor</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-toolkit/blob/master/iface/inc/WireCellIface/ITensorSet.h"><code>ITensorSet</code></a>) and an extension to a ZIO message form called TENS
(<a href="https://github.com/brettviren/zio/blob/master/inc/zio/tens.hpp">C++ util</a>) which is compatible with FLOW forms.  The object schema
takes guidance from Eigen3, <code>boost::multiarray</code> and HDF5 and so allows
"impedance matched" conversion between these implementations.</li>

<li>Upgraded the C++ implementation of ZIO flow protocol to use an
explicit finite state machine.  The motivation was that the
hand-rolled FSM of if/else branches was getting crazy.  It makes use
of <a href="https://boost-experimental.github.io/sml/">boost.sml</a>. Here is a <a href="https://brettviren.github.io/zio/flowsm.png">state diagram</a> semi-automatically generated
from <code>boost.sml</code></li>

<li>Moved ZIO to use <a href="https://github.com/gabime/spdlog">spdlog</a> to help compatibility for WCT integration.</li>

<li>After a long and very helpful discussion in the <a href="https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq/pull/391">pull request</a> I
contributed an implementation of the CZMQ message codec to cppzmq.
There is another <a href="https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq/pull/392">open PR</a> to add an implementation of the "actor
pattern" (influenced by CZMQ).  After another long and useful
discussion there, it may be rescinded and in any case is in limbo.
A version of the actor is in ZIO.</li>

<li>Created <a href="https://github.com/brettviren/generaldomo">generaldomo</a> C++ and Python which is a generalization of
ZeroMQ Majordomo (v1) protocol and reference implementation from the
Zguide so that it may thread safe CLIENT/SERVER as well as
traditional DEALER/ROUTER sockets.  This work required/inspired the
contribution of the codec to cppzmq.</li>

<li>Integrated a variant of generaldomo's into ZIO as "domo".  This
forms the basis for the WCT/ZIO/PyTorch GPU service.</li>

<li>Started ZIO integration into WCT for HDF5 I/O and GPU service
support.  This is organized through WireCell GitHub <a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-toolkit/projects/8">project/8</a>.  The
FSM upgrade is part of <a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-toolkit/issues/54">issue/54</a>.</li>

<li>Various cleanups in WCT build system, now with auto-generated
<a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-toolkit/raw/master/wct-deps.png">dependency tree GraphViz diagram</a>.</li>

<li>In DUNE FD DAQ we had a <del>fight over</del> discussion about whether to adopt
a distributed vs a centralize philosophy, with me on the side of the
former.  It was agreed to do a demo of each approach to compare the
performance of two.  I wrote one in a few hours leveraging ZIO.  I
have a <a href="https://brettviren.github.io/zio/ex-distribution.html">write up</a> on my demo that shows how to exercise it.  Meanwhile
the centralized proponents haven't even answered any of my email
about this.  The DUNE DAQ consortium can be a rather frustrating
"collaboration".</li>

<li>Speaking of DUNE DAQ, an "application framework" task force was
started at the CERN DAQ workshop.  It is roughly centered on two
GitHub repos <a href="https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/app-framework-base">app-framework-base</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/app-framework">app-framework</a>.  The effort here
so far largely ignores the lessons learned and software technology
developed in PTMP which brought self-trigging to ProtoDUNE.
Frustrating.  Instead a rather centralized and "offline" approach is
being pursued.  More frustration.</li>

<li>Last weekend I wrote a "tour" of ZeroMQ's C++ API.  It's currently
served from: <a href="https://brettviren.github.io/cppzmq-tour/">https://brettviren.github.io/cppzmq-tour/</a> and we may
integrate it into ZeroMQ more closely.</li>

<li>Haiwang has advanced his DL signal-ROI finder, testing different
networks.  Looking at some stability issues in the loss function on
corner case events and if they are driven by how the training sample
phase space is populated.</li>

<li>Haiwang has joined the HEP-CCE PPS effort to port bottleneck
algorithms to use <a href="https://kokkos.org/">Kokkos</a> for portable cpu/gpu/etc parallel
algorithms.  We have also met with BNL CSI and Kyle Knoepfel (FNAL
art developer) on how HEP-CCE activities will progress.  The
decision is that we focus on WCT simulation algorithms for porting
to Kokkos.  And, for now, will do development using a job that runs
WCT on top of art/larsoft.  This will immediately allow a vector to
get rich sets of Geant4 energy depositions into the WCT simulation.
It will also allow the Kokkos work to later run in a more stripped
down and HPC-friendly way through stand-alone WCT.</li>

<li>Wenqian and Andrea added initial support to WCT for ICARUS including
noise filtering and coherent noise model for the simulation.  This
latter improved WCT to make the previously hard-coded
cold-electronics response function be dynamically replaceable to
accomodate the warm electronics response used by ICARUS.</li>

<li>Haiwang began the much anticipated refactoring of the signal
processing which will give better code modularity and finer grained
parallel processing.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orged5dffc">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ZIO is reached a milestone of functionality for its first use
(multi-threaded file I/O) and now has a set of <a href="https://brettviren.github.io/zio/tutorial.html">tutorials</a>, one for
each major concept.  Focus is not on the next phase which is
providing support for CPU/GPU resource balancing brokers.  This
started with providing back to the ZeroMQ community an <a href="https://github.com/booksbyus/zguide/commit/d1818973c6a21605c18e452a4d64c8fc8342f6a2">upgrade</a> to
the Majordomo example from the <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc98">Zguide</a>.</li>

<li>Haiwang continues his work on <a href="https://indico.bnl.gov/event/7608/contributions/34912/attachments/26525/40172/2019-02-06_Integration.pdf">DL ROI finding</a> as part of Wire-Cell
Toolkit LArTPC signal processing.  His technique gets superior
efficiency and purity for collecting ionization signals especially
for difficult high-angle tracks.  Running inference on CPU takes
about 24 s per event and on GPU about 200 ms which is now comparable
to times required for internal data conversion.  Profiling the job
and making some optimistic linear scaling assumptions indicate one
GPU (2080ti) would require 2500 CPU cores running the rest of the
WCT payload in order to balance the two resources.</li>

<li>Kwang Min Yu (CSI), Haiwang and BV met to discuss Kwang Min's recent
developments in porting parts of Wire-Cell Toolkit's drift
simulation to GPU.  He achieves 4.7x speed increase in the code
itself providing 2.6x speed up in the overall simulation job.  The
code involves rastering each 2D Gaussian model of drifted ionization
energy depositions onto a small "patch" grid and applying binomial
fluctuations.  The next step for these patches are to sum them onto
a larger grid and perform convolution with detector response.  This
summing inherently resists GPU parallelism.  Kwang Min described
possible "divide and conquer" strategies to attack this problem and
this would be the next step but first Haiwang and BV need to "catch"
up by understanding the GPU code and integrating it into WCT,
proper.</li>

<li>Wenqian Gu has been trying to understand potential disagreement in
dE/dX in Wire-Cell Toolkit.  This may be usual confusion over
Geant4's energy "deposition" vs energy "loss" or it may be some real
problem.  The discrepancy was larger when larger max step size in
Geant4 was used.  Going from 0.9mm to 0.3mm allows the discrepancy
to be removed by an ad-hoc 15% "calibration".  Work is ongoing to
understand the nature of this.</li>

<li>Next week is a DUNE DAQ workshop at CERN.</li>

<p>
Xmas/New Years and general laziness mean these updates cover more than
one week of activity.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Wire-Cell Toolkit release branch 0.13.x made (Haiwang) with release
<a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-toolkit/releases/tag/0.13.0">0.13.0</a> and quickly following <a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-toolkit/releases/tag/0.13.1">0.13.1</a> which just removed some cruft
unintentionally left in.  They are the first release after moving
the toolkit source to a mono-repo assembled from the old individual
repos using <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo">git subrepo</a> and includes many important algorithm
additions and improvements not the least of which is bringing back
support for multi-threaded graph execution and support for deep
network machine learning based signal-ROI finding.  More details
listed in the 0.13.0 release notes.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tangentially unrelated, the LArSoft source code management has
moved from Fermilab Redmine to <a href="https://github.com/larsoft">https://github.com/larsoft</a>.  It
now follows a fork+PR-based contribution model.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/brettviren/zio">ZIO</a> has matured greatly since last update but still has more to
come.  Since last highlight, it has gained an implementation of the
<a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc211">"credit based flow control"</a> protocol described in the ZeroMQ guide.
However, ZIO flow uses SERVER/CLIENT sockets (in draft) instead of
ROUTER/DEALER in order to assure thread safety if/when sockets are
utilized from changing threads (as will happen with TBB based
multi-thread graph exeuction).  ZIO now includes both C++ and Python
implementation of the major patterns (<code>message</code>, <code>peer</code>, <code>node</code>, <code>port</code> and
<code>flow</code>).  A documentation website for <a href="https://brettviren.github.io/zio/">ZIO</a> was started.</li>

<li>The WCT subpackage <a href="https://github.com/brettviren/wire-cell-zpb">ZPB</a> was started.  It provides the WCT end of a
ZIO flow.  It also has a documentation home page: <a href="https://brettviren.github.io/wire-cell-zpb/">ZPB</a>.  Current ZPB
functionality includes extracting WCT "depo" and "frame" data types
from components running inside the single or multi-threaded WCT
graph execution engines, conversion to protobuf (the "PB" in "ZPB")
objects in ZIO messages, transferring them over ZIO/ZeroMQ (the "Z"
in "ZPB"), receiving the message in a broker and saving to HDF5.
Reading/injecting back into the graph is nearly complete.  The
broker is implemented generically in Python in the ZIO Python
package and ZPB provides a domain-specific "broker factory plugin"
which itself is plugable for both the message payload schema (but
limited to just protobuf format for now) and the file format (HDF5
implemented, ROOT maybe next).</li>

<li>DUNE DAQ is discussing software build and other software management
issues.  FNAL is trying to replace their long standing "augmented"
CMake package-level build system + their suite of shell scripted
meta build system with a new "augmented" CMake build system + Spack.
(editorial comment: the latter is welcome, but the former is still a
core mistake that limits the portability of code that employs the
"augmented" CMake package build.)</li>

<li>The ZIO package started last week has reached a maturity to go on to
the next step of seeing how to integrate it into Wire-Cell toolkit.
A likely problem was uncovered in mixing Zio's ZeroMQ with WCT's MT
graph execution engine based on TBB "flow graph": in general, ZMQ
sockets can not be sent across thread boundaries without hitting
undefined behavior.  Work is still ongoing to understand and
demonstrate the problem but it may be a show stopper in mixing these
two technologies.  Any input on this topic from the group is very
welcome.</li>

BV and Haiwang met with CSI (Meifeng, Kwangmin, Zhihua) yesterday to
sync up about recent HEP-CCE activities as well as Wire-Cell
parallelizing/optimizing.  BV was asked to participate in CCE-IOS
(I/O + storage, meeting next Friday), Meifeng is in CCE-PPS
(portable parallelism, meeting next Monday) and asked BV to
participate in that as well.  
</p>

<p>
Haiwang reported on his recent work on Wire-Cell's component-level
parallel execution engine based on TBB.  Single threaded jobs are
just above 1 GB, multi-threaded jobs with 1 pipeline for each of 6
ProtoDUNE APAs achieves near 600% CPU usage in those pipelines and
uses less than 3 GB.  
</p>

<p>
Haiwang also presented his work on improvements on the quality of
the "region-of-interest" half of Wire-Cell signal processing via
machine learning techniques based on image segmentation.  Evaluation
is based on visually checking ROI results and is clearly better than
the current heuristic based ROI finding in terms of completeness and
spatial resolution.  Kwangmin remarked on the relatively low number
of training epochs used (5) and Haiwang will investigate how results
might change as a function of this number.
</p></li>

<li>A new project (<a href="https://github.com/brettviren/zio">zio</a>) was started as a basis for solutions of several
similar problems but in rather different spaces.  Some additional
info is in the README and updates will be provided as the project
develops.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://github.com/brettviren/tpquery">TP Query</a> package for DUNE FD DAQ reached an initial milestone of
usability.  It provides a ZeroMQ based streamed buffer query system
based on interval trees and applied to providing a database of
recent self-trigger information for ProtoDUNE.  It was tested using
PTMP's "replay" mechanism with trigger messages dumped from
ProtoDUNE.  It sustains sufficient throughput for buffers of a few
seconds deep for the aggregate of 1 APA (~80kHz of intervals) but
will slow beyond that (the relevant interval tree operations are
N*log(N)).  This is likely sufficient as-is but at least one
approach exists to combat this slowdown if longer buffers are
needed.  It's unclear when this might be tested "live" at ProtoDUNE
but it was recently learned that PDSP will run into April.
Unidentified artdaq developer effort is needed if this buffer query
is to lead to data sent to offline files but a quicker "live" test
can be developed entirely using PTMP based code.</li>

<li>DUNE FD DAQ began technical discussions about how to handle
"observability" with initial focus on metrics.  Two presentations
are here <a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/event/22481/">https://indico.fnal.gov/event/22481/</a>.  Of particular note
to NPPS, I mentioned Sergey Padolski's BDT work for Panda as
something we should look into more.</li>
